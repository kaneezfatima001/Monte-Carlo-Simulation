    "Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for simulating investment returns and assessing risk. By introducing randomness into the model, the simulation takes into account the volatility of the investment and generates a range of potential outcomes. The resulting distribution of possible investment returns can be analyzed to calculate risk metrics such as VaR and ES, which provide a quantitative measure of the level of risk associated with the investment. These risk metrics can help investors make more informed decisions about their investment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different distributions such as poisson, lognormal, and skew can be used to generate random rates of return within a given range. Sensitivity analysis can be used to test the robustness of the model to different parameters. Risk assessment using VaR and ES can be used to determine the probability of large losses and help investors manage their risk exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Monte Carlo simulation can be a valuable tool for assessing investment risk and making data-driven decisions."
